I just begin learning html and css and this is my first youtube clone webiste which i made for my html and css practice.
It was a lot of fun of doing these type projects and especially building clones of real world websites like facebook and amazon and you name it.
It was the biggest achievement of mine as a begginer. Now i will be looking forward to build more things. I am happy you see my projects.
